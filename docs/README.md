# Docs folder

Trestle uses mkdocs for creating a documenation website. If you are looking for that documentation online check here:
https://compliance-trestle.github.io. Documenation can be generated locally by running `make docs-site`.

Inside this folder `specifications` contains trestle developer documentation and `assets` contains binary artifacts for
trestle development / docs website.
